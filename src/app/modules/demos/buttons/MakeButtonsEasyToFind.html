<h3>Make Buttons Easy to Find</h3>
<p>
    Users have enough distractions on the page. Don't hide the things they need to see.
</p>
<small>Example (Bad)</small>
<div class="well">
    <div class="row">
        <div class="col-xs-12">
            <p class="small"> One of the words in this paragraph is actually a button. It blends in with its <button class="btn btn-xs">surroundings</button>, making it harder to see. Imagine if a button that doesn't look like a button is hidden on a page full of images, text, and other things.  </p>

<div class="well">
    <div class="row">
        <div class="col-xs-12">
            <p class="small"> One of the words in this paragraph is actually a button. It stands out in its <button class="btn btn-success btn-xs">surroundings</button>, making it easier to see. A user looking for the button can see it immediately. Imagine if you could immediately find the button you wanted on a page full of images, text, and other things.  </p>
